**Unit 2: Exploration & Expansion: Europe, 1500-1700** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Between 1500 and 1700, Europe reasserted its global dominance after
almost a millennium of cultural, military, political, and economic
submission to the Arab Middle East and North Africa.  Europe’s newfound
power was buttressed by economic growth that was in turn made possible
by changes in the political scene, specifically the death of feudalism
and the rise of the European middle class.  In addition, European
economic growth was aided by the enslavement of millions of Africans
whose labor allowed the European colonies in the New World (the
Americas) to enrich the mother countries. In this unit, students will
explore the roots of European political and economic change between 1500
and 1700, specifically the Protestant Reformation (which weakened the
bond between governments and the Church and, over time, eroded monarchs’
political power) and the rise of Enlightenment philosophy, which
provided the intellectualframework for more democratic governments.
Finally, students will learn how these two developments pushed Europeans
to explore first Africa and then the Americas; these explorations led to
vast new natural resources and slave labor that enriched Europe and
eventually made Great Britain the dominant world power by the beginning
of the eighteenth-century.*
