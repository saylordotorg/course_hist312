**Unit 10: Progressivism and World War I** <span id="10"></span> 
*Some view Progressivism (1890-1914) as an approach to reducing the
tension between capital and democracy by regulating corporations and
alleviating the worst sufferings of poor Americans. Progressivism is
best understood as a reaction against the excesses of the Gilded Age,
specifically the corrupt political influence of men like Andrew Carnegie
and the violent and repeated clashes between labor and capital. In many
ways, many Progressives saw themselves as trying to “split the
difference” between Hamilton’s vision for America and Jefferson’s,
though the movement itself was really an inchoate collection of smaller,
sometimes antagonistic movements bound together mostly by their shared
antipathy toward the status quo; because of this, Progressives often
spent as much energy fighting each other as they did fighting their
enemies on the right and the left.*
