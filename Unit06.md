**Unit 6: The Market Revolution and Antebellum America** <span
id="6"></span> 
*This unit explores the explosive economic growth unleashed by the
conclusion of the War of 1812 and the concomitant expansion of political
participation, a process known as democratization.  Often called the
“Era of the Common Man,” the period between 1820 and 1850 came to be
symbolized by Andrew Jackson, a man who saw himself as heir to the
agrarian republicanism promoted by Jefferson.  Ironically, it was
Hamilton’s vision of industrial economic growth that created the
conditions that made the expansion of the electorate possible, which in
turn allowed Jackson to be elected president.*
