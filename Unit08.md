**Unit 8: The American Civil War** <span id="8"></span> 
*One of the defining events in American history, the Civil War was a
contest between the divergent strands of American political and economic
thinking – the Hamiltonian vision, which argued for industrial growth
and supported widespread enfranchisement, and the Jeffersonian vision,
which proposed a racially stratified agrarian society where white men’s
democratic rights came at the expense of African slavery.*
