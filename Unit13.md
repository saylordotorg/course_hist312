*Since 1970, capital and democracy have slowly returned to the
antagonistic positions they occupied for much of the late
19<sup>th</sup> century; by the 1990s, many observers began referring to

economy shifted from manufacturing to “knowledge-based” fields or
service industries, the class differences between those with college
degrees and those without increased while, at the same time, political
participation in national elections steadily declined.*
