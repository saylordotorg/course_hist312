**Unit 7: Westward Expansion** <span id="7"></span> 
*Part of America’s continued economic success is due to the availability
of land; the West functioned not just as a place, but also as an idea of
what the ideal American society would look like.  In theory, it was a
place where the fluidity of society allowed anyone to reinvent himself
or herself and rise from pauperism to prosperity.  To most Americans,
this rags-to-riches tale represented true democracy.  Reality often
diverged from the ideal, however, and the West was violent, dangerous,
and often as undemocratic as any city in the East.*
