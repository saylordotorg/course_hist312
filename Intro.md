Course Syllabus for "HIST312: Capitalism and Democracy in America"
------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this course is to trace the twin paths of capitalism and
democracy through American history.  This course is premised on the idea
that capitalism and democracy are intertwined, though they have often
conflicted with one another.  One reason that democracy and capitalism
often conflict is because capitalism has the capacity for both enormous
construction and enormous destruction; these contradictory impulses
often appear in tandem.  This course is structured to provide students
with a brief introduction to the history of capitalism and democracy in
Europe and then to explore how they evolved in North America between
1600 and the present.  Throughout the course, students will be exposed
to primary and secondary readings as well as video and audio lectures
that will explore the connections between America’s economic and
political development This course assumes a basic working knowledge of
U.S. history.  A good resource for review is
