**Unit 1: Origins of Capitalism and Democracy in Europe to 1500** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This chapter will introduce you to European economic and political
developments up to 1500, focusing specifically on Europe during the
so-called “Dark Ages” (medieval period).  We will place particular
emphasis on the close relationship between political and economic
status, particularly under the feudal system; this is one of the
course’s themes, so it is important to understand how European
precedents shaped developments in America with regard to the eventual
emergence of capitalism and democracy.*
