**Unit 12: Post-War America in 1970** <span id="12"></span> 
*Following World War II, the United States rose to global dominance of
what* Time*publisher Henry Luce called “The American Century.”  Though
locked in an ideological struggle with the Soviet Union, the United
States exercised an unprecedented amount of global power fueled by its
economic and military strength.  Because of America’s almost unrivaled
position as the factory and breadbasket of the world, the U.S.  economy
grew exponentially, expanding the middle class and shrinking the
distance between the “haves” and “have-nots.”  One consequence was what
many scholars view as the high-water mark of American political
participation in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.*
