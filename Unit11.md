**Unit 11: The "Roaring" 1920s, Great Depression and World War II**
<span id="11"></span> 
*The Great Depression was a turning point in the relationship between
democracy and capitalism.  The Roosevelt administration’s response to
the Great Depression was a series of programs known as The New Deal that
were aimed at curbing the business excesses that had characterized the
1920s and ensuring that all Americans had some basic level of social
security.  Roosevelt’s successful prosecution of World War II burnished
his reputation as a great president, which consequently cemented the New
Deal’s place at the center of American economic and political ideology
for the next quarter century.*

**11.1.3 Criticism of the “Roaring Twenties:” The Great Gatsby** <span
id="11.1.3"></span> 
*Not everyone was pleased about the economic and political changes
taking place in the 1920s—some felt that the growth in consumer debt and
the introduction of labor-saving devices like the automobile signaled
the death of traditional American values, like hard-work and thrift. 
Others deplored the rising numbers of people with self-made wealth (the
“nouveau riche”).  F. Scott Fitzgerald’s* The Great Gatsby*has come to
be viewed as the seminal literary critique of American society in the
1920s; the book’s depiction of the listless, unhappy, and criminal lives
of America’s wealthy was a scathing indictment of the consequences of
America’s newfound wealth.*
