**Unit 9: Post Civil War America: The Gilded Age (1870-1897)** <span
id="9"></span> 
*The federal government’s victory in the American Civil War was followed
by nearly seventy years of Republican dominance of the national
government.  During this period, the tension between democracy and
capitalism, which had been growing since at least the 1820s, increased,
and a series of presidential administrations shifted the balance
decisively toward capital.  This led to a reaction from organized labor,
which based its appeal on (among other things) democracy.*
