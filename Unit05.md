**Unit 5: Federalism and Republicanism in America, 1790-1815** <span
id="5"></span> 
*This unit explores the period of American history best symbolized by
two men who are often depicted as the embodiments of capitalism and
democracy: Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.  We will study the
tension between Americans who advocated for an economy based on
manufacturing and aided by a strong central government (Hamilton) and
those who argued for an agricultural economy unfettered by government
regulation (Jefferson).  We will also discuss the mounting importance of
the issue of slavery, which many Northerners had begun to consider
undemocratic and therefore contradictory to the American constitution. 
Southern slaveholders, by contrast, argued that their democracy was
predicated upon owning slaves, a tension that could only be resolved by
the American Civil War.*
