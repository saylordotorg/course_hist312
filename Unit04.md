*This unit examines the reasons why Britain’s American colonies rebelled

participation.*

    since been amended or superseded.  The United States Constitution
    was drafted in the summer of 1787 and ratified (agreed upon) by most
    of the thirteen original states over the following year. The
    Constitution lays out the basic institutions of the United States
    federal government and their function while an ancillary document –
    the Bill of Rights, or the first ten amendments to the Constitution
    – places limitations on the power of government to infringe upon
    individual property, religious, and political rights.
